## FAQ

*Q: I'm not a frequent R user, and I'm afraid I won't understand the presentations.*

A: No worries! Our meetups are open to people from all levels and also aim for networking. We also encourage to ask questions if something is not clear.


*Q: I'm a guy, and it seems this meetup is only for women.*

A: This group is mainly aimed at minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) but is open to all that agree to the [CoC](https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/). However, leadership roles remain reserved for minority genders.
