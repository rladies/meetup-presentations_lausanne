Rosalie Bruel [<i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>](https://twitter.com/rosaliebruel)[<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/rosalieb/) has a background in ecology research, where she just finished her PhD on lakes ecological response to climate change.

As one of our first supporters, she missed our lightening talk session in June as she will soon head to Vermont. 

Luckily for us, she proposed to do a [Twitter thread](twitter thread) instead on her work in environmental research. For French speakers: she has also did a ReCur week for [@laBioauLabo](https://twitter.com/laBioauLabo/status/980716083685584896).

#### R-Ladies Lausanne: What is the work that you do?
<u>Rosalie Bruel</u>: 
I am an ecologist, *working on lakes responses to climate change*. I just finished my PhD in Thonon, on Lake Geneva French shores. My objective was to quantify ecological changes due to climate change, and to understand whether eutrophication mediate this. Eutrophication is a natural process of water enrichment by nutrients (nitrate, phosphate), but changes in land-use and cities development accelerate the process worldwide, creating an important threat to freshwater and marine systems.


#### RLL: What do you use R for at work?
<u>RB</u>: I use R for all my data analyses and generation of figures.

#### RLL: Where and when did you learn R?
<u>RB</u>: I’ve first learned to use R during my Master in Anglet, France. It’s only during my Master’s internships and the projects we had to carry out that I really managed to write my first R-scripts. The best way to learn R in my opinion is to have (1) a specific question and (2) a familiar dataset and then spend time on it.

#### RLL: Do you use R outside work?
<u>RB</u>: No, not really. I used it once to show my dad that R was better than excel to extract some statistics from a run we did.
However, I feel that learning to program in R provided me with a mindset that helps me understand today's technology much better. For example, already knowing about if-else-conditions and how they are used in programming. 
R also provides a great philosophy for research in general, because using an open source software means less barriers for other users, easy possibility of sharing and reproducibility has helped me looking at other problems differently: if you’re stuck, ask your colleagues, and not necessarily in your field. Most of the questions in R have been answered at some point, so don’t hesitate to ask for help!


#### RLL: What are your favourite R tools?
<u>RB</u>: R tools that I use very often and that give me a lot of flexibility are the iteration possibility (for-loops), subsetting of data according to some condition, and all the different functions around that. R is great for testing robustness of your results, as it allows you to resample from your data very easily. I use it a lot when I need to test whether a trend I observe on a specific period would also been observed for shorter periods, or if I had sampled differently.

I also love the fact that you can reproduce your analyses even months after writing it. With the way the reviewing process works for scientific papers, it is very helpful to have your workflow analysis archived somewhere when you have to re-do your analyses months after the first submission.

It also straightforward  to share your scripts and methods with everyone. 

#### RLL: What resources do you use when you get stuck? 
<u>RB</u>: I always google first, and when I have the time to read help from several sources, I go to Stackoverflow.
I do my research in English, but [[ere](https://statistique-et-logiciel-r.com) is a blog resource in French by another R-Ladies member, Claire Della Vedova. 

#### RLL: What do you aspire to learn in R?
<u>RB</u>: I want to learn how to use `purrr` for iterations instead of loops. I started working on very large datasets and I’m wasting a lot of computation time by using ‘for’ loops.
Also, I don’t know how to use `ggplot2`, which is very frustrating as everyone loves it. 

#### RLL: What motivated you to give a talk at R-Ladies Lausanne?
<u>RB</u>: I don’t have a high R level compared to other people, but at the same time, R is making so many easy-to-do routines that are not used by many people, which makes me wonder why not everyone is using it.

I always feel a bit ashamed to show my R scripts, because they are not optimal, but that doesn’t mean they do not provide me with an answer to my research question.

So I hope that by giving insight into the life of an average R-user I can remove some people complexes about starting to use R and motivate them to share their knowledge.

#### RLL:	Do you have any free advertisement for a not-for profit organisation or resource?
<u>RB</u>: There is an [event around science](http://centre.mjc-annemasse.fr/evenement/2018-06-11/504-faites-de-la-science.html ) in Annemasse (near Geneva on the French side) in June (11-18). You can also check out the [FabLac](https://fablac.fr ) (a FabLab in Anthy-sur-Léman, France), that organizes some repair shops, and much more.

#### RLL: Thank you for your time you invested into this interview and the twitter thread & all the best for start in Vermont!
<u>RB</u>: Thank you for your implication (engagement?) and I wish R-Ladies Lausanne a long serie of successful and informative meetings!


#### Technical note:
*Rosalie provided the answers to the questions in written form which were then adapted during an informal interview with Sina. Some text was changed for clarification.*
