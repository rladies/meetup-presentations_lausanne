[R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) is a world-wide organization to **promote gender diversity** in the *R community*.

## Upcoming Events

Our next event will be in **December 3rd 2019** â†’ see [meetup page](http://meetu.ps/c/3Flzf/vBnX0/f) for more informations.


## R-Ladies Global

The mission of **R-Ladies** is to achieve proportionate representation of genders currently underrepresented in the R community by **encouraging**, **inspiring**, and **empowering** them.

[R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/about-us/team/) provides support to local (and remote) *chapters* that exist around the world.

### Chapters
Chapters are somewhat similar to R-user groups. 

There are plenty of chapters around the world, listed [here](https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/blob/master/Current-Chapters.csv). 

There is also an [app](https://gqueiroz.shinyapps.io/rshinylady/) that lists the current meetups and a [map](https://github.com/rladies/Map-RLadies-Growing) that shows the evolution over time.

Find material on other chapters meetups at this [github repository](https://github.com/rladies/) (search for repositories named `meetup-presentations_TOWN`).

### Remote
There is also an [R-Ladies Remote](https://twitter.com/rladiesremote?lang=de) chapter for people that either work remotely, or have no local chapter nearby. 

## R-Ladies Lausanne
The chapter in Lausanne was founded in November 2017.
