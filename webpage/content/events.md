In 2020, we will try to have a meetup once month (4th week of the month). 

The content of our meetups varies: 

- A mix of **short talks** on a range of topics. This is an excellent opportunity for everyone to present what they are passionate about. *For example: Favourite R packages*, *Applications for which you use R*, *The best way to learn R*. 
- **How-tos/Tutorials** of R-packages and applications. Are you an experienced in an R-related-topic that you would like to share and others to learn? *For example: integrating code into text and making it reproducible: rmarkdown and knitr, tidyr, shiny*.
- **Tutorials** on *getting started in R*. 

If you would like to **speak at a meetup** or have an idea for an event :arrow_right: [email us](emailto:lausanne@rladies.org).

We also encourage you to **bring along your R problems** 30 min before the meetup starts - we :purple_heart: solving R riddles!

## Upcoming Events

Our next event will be on **December 3rd 2019** â†’ see [meetup page](http://meetu.ps/c/3Flzf/vBnX0/f) for more informations.
